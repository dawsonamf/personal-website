**Dawson Metzger-Fleetwood** ("we", "us", or "our") operates the website and various applications (collectively, the "Service"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our website or use our mobile applications ("Applications").

By using our Applications or website, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 1. Information Collection

### A. Information You Provide
We may collect information that you voluntarily provide to us when you use our Applications. This includes:
*   **Account Information:** If an Application requires you to create an account, we may collect your email address, name, or a unique user identifier (such as those provided by "Sign in with Apple"). This is used solely for authentication and account management.

To ensure the stability and security of our Applications, we may receive limited technical metadata. This includes information such as:
*   **Device Specifications:** Device model and operating system version.
*   **Service Analytics:** Aggregated, non-identifying information regarding Application performance and usage patterns to help us optimize the user experience.

This data is used exclusively for diagnosing technical issues and optimizing Application performance. We do not use this data for tracking, advertising, or building user profiles.

### C. Financial Data (FinanceKit)
For Applications utilizing FinanceKit, we adhere to a "privacy-by-default" architecture:
*   **Local Processing:** All financial data accessed via FinanceKit is processed locally on your device. 
*   **No Server Transmission:** We do not transmit, store, or have access to your raw financial transactions or account balances on our external servers.
*   **User Control:** Access to financial data is strictly controlled by system-level permissions which you can revoke at any time.

### D. Device Permissions
Certain Applications may request access to specific features on your mobile device. These may include:
*   **Camera & Microphone:** To capture photos, record videos, or record audio within the Application.
*   **Photo Library:** To save or upload images.
*   **Location Services:** To provide location-based features. We do not track your location in the background unless explicitly stated within the Application.

Requests for access to these features will be presented by the operating system, and you may revoke these permissions at any time via your device settings.

## 2. Use of Information
We use the information collected for the following purposes:
*   To provide and maintain the functionality of our Applications.
*   To manage user accounts and authentication.
*   To improve our Applications and perform technical troubleshooting.
*   To comply with legal obligations.

## 3. Data Storage and Security
*   **On-Device & iCloud:** For many of our Applications, your data is stored locally on your device or synchronized via your personal iCloud account. We do not have access to data stored in your personal iCloud.
*   **External Servers:** In some cases, we may use third-party cloud services (such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure) to host backend services. We prioritize services that offer end-to-end encryption or robust data protection.
*   **Security:** We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

## 4. Third-Party Services
We may employ third-party companies and individuals for the following reasons:
*   To facilitate our Service;

*   To perform Service-related services; or

**We do not sell your personal data to third parties, nor do we use third-party advertising networks.**

## 5. Children’s Privacy
Our Applications and website are not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided me with personal information, please contact us.

## 6. Your Rights
Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data, such as the right to access, correct, or delete your data.
