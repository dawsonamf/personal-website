A few months ago I stumbled across [obra/smallest-agent](https://github.com/obra/smallest-agent), a repo that defines a fully functional coding agent (the core of Claude code, openclaw, etc.), but in as few bytes as possible. Stripped down it’s one single 493 byte file defining the agent loop; sending messages to Anthropic’s api, a command line tool, waiting for and executing those tool calls, and printing to the terminal. That’s it. 493 bytes is not a lot. To put it in perspective, this paragraph is also exactly 493 bytes.

As a software engineer, I've been working with coding agents for nearly two years. To see that the core logic could be implemented so simply was kind of awesome. Naturally I spun up Docker and built for Linux distribution, excited to see the smallest compiled binary I had ever seen. Of course, I was very disappointed. Smallest-agent uses Bun as the runtime, and therefore must pull in all of Bun's dependencies. Without those dependencies, that one file wouldn't know how to make an HTTPS request, parse JSON, spawn a process, or read an environment variable. It couldn't write to the terminal, handle async execution, or catch a Ctrl+C. The 493 bytes describe what the agent does, and absolutely nothing else. It's standing on the shoulders of the giant that is Bun's runtime. Compiled, the actual binary size was around 95 megabytes.

At this point in my career, I'd heard about embedded systems but never really thought too hard about what working with them implied. While defining the core agent loop in 493 bytes is cool and educational, I became interested in how small I could make the total binary. I was working primarily with Swift at this point, poking around the Swift forums and looking for an excuse to install a dev toolchain. So I decided to see if I could pull this off in embedded Swift.

## Plain Swift

To start off, I implemented the agent loop in plain Swift. This was relatively straightforward and clean to look at. I added a few features beyond smallest-agent that I thought were useful enough to be worth adding: streaming responses via Server-Sent Events, parallel tool execution, subagents that could spawn their own conversation contexts, and real-time steering so you could redirect the agent between tool calls. Foundation gave me URLSession for networking, JSONEncoder/JSONDecoder with Codable for serialization, and Process for spawning shell commands. Swift's async/await handled concurrency. The code read like what you'd expect from any standard Swift project. But, because I pulled in Foundation, the compiled binary was around 76 megabytes.

## The Embedded Swift Rabbit Hole

So, I installed the swift dev nightly toolchain and set the flag to build for embedded Swift. I wasn't using very many language features, so I figured it may be a minor cleanup to get it to run. I was wrong. Almost everything I took for granted lives in Foundation. URLSession was gone. Even Codable was gone. The concurrency model I had been using since college was gone. There was no Process, no type erasure, and much of the String API was gone too. All I got it seemed was structs, enums, generics, closures, and (most importantly) C interop.

## Building a Foundation

### Networking

No `URLSession` means wrapping libcurl via C interop. But Swift can't call variadic C functions, and `curl_easy_setopt` is variadic — it takes a `CURLoption` and then... whatever type that option expects. So the first thing I wrote was `shim.h`: a set of static inline C wrappers that turn each variadic call into a strongly-typed one.

```c
static inline CURLcode curl_easy_setopt_string(CURL *curl, CURLoption option, const char *param) {
    return curl_easy_setopt(curl, option, param);
}

static inline CURLcode curl_easy_setopt_writefunc(CURL *curl, curl_write_callback callback) {
    return curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION, callback);
}
```

Then there's the streaming problem. An LLM API sends SSE, which is a stream of newline-delimited JSON chunks. libcurl delivers data in arbitrarily-sized buffers via a C callback. The callback needs to buffer bytes, split on newlines, and invoke a Swift closure for each complete line.

The trick I found is `Unmanaged`. You can't pass a Swift closure through a C function pointer. But you can wrap a Swift object in `Unmanaged`, convert it to an opaque pointer, pass that as `CURLOPT_WRITEDATA`, and recover it inside the `@convention(c)` callback:

```swift
let ctx = StreamContext(onLine: onLine, abortFlag: abortFlag)
let ctxPtr = Unmanaged.passRetained(ctx).toOpaque()
defer { Unmanaged<StreamContext>.fromOpaque(ctxPtr).release() }

curl_easy_setopt_writefunc(curl, curlWriteCallback)
curl_easy_setopt_writedata(curl, ctxPtr)
```

Inside the callback, you recover the context, buffer bytes, and split on `0x0A`. The abort flag is wired through too. If the user hits Ctrl+C, the callback returns 0, which tells curl to abort the transfer. Clean cancellation from a signal handler, through C, into a Swift object, back through C, into libcurl. I don't think this is particularly beautiful, but it does work.

### Shell

No `Process` means we must use `posix_spawn`. Pipe management, environment passing, stdout/stderr merging, all manually. The implementation creates a pipe, sets up `posix_spawn_file_actions` to redirect the child's stdout and stderr to the write end, spawns `/bin/sh -c <command>`, reads from the read end until EOF, then `waitpid`s for the exit code.

```swift
posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2(&fileActions, writeEnd, STDOUT_FILENO)
posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2(&fileActions, writeEnd, STDERR_FILENO)
posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose(&fileActions, readEnd)
posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose(&fileActions, writeEnd)
```

The exit code extraction was its own piece of work. You have to manually decode the `waitpid` status with bitwise operations to distinguish normal exits from signal kills.

### String operations

Embedded Swift's standard library doesn't include the Unicode normalization and grapheme-breaking tables. This means `String.count`, `range(of:)`, `hasPrefix(_:)`, and `replacingOccurrences(of:)` either don't exist or pull in massive tables that blow up the binary.

The solution is to put everything through the UTF-8 view. Byte-level comparisons, byte-level searching, byte-level truncation. `utf8HasPrefix`, `utf8Equal`, `utf8DropFirst`, `utf8Truncate`. A collection of functions that do what the standard library does, but by iterating raw bytes:

```swift
func utf8HasPrefix(_ s: String, _ prefix: String) -> Bool {
    var si = s.utf8.makeIterator()
    var pi = prefix.utf8.makeIterator()
    while let pb = pi.next() {
        guard let sb = si.next(), sb == pb else { return false }
    }
    return true
}
```

It's not Unicode-correct in the general case, but for an agent that's parsing ASCII-heavy SSE streams and JSON, it's probably fine and keeps the binary small.

### Concurrency

No `async/await`, no `Task`, no `DispatchQueue`, no structured concurrency at all. When the LLM requests multiple tool calls, they need to run in parallel. When the user types while the agent is running, that input needs to be captured on a background thread and routed to the right queue.

The answer: raw pthreads, mutexes, and condition variables. The `ThreadSafeQueue` is a FIFO backed by a pthread mutex and condition variable, with `push`, `popFirst`, and `waitAndPop(timeoutMs:)`. The `InputReader` spawns a background pthread that reads stdin in a loop and routes lines to either the steering queue (if the agent is running) or the direct input queue (if it's idle).

Parallel tool execution works by spawning one pthread per tool call, each with its own `ParallelToolContext` passed through `Unmanaged`:

```swift
let ctxPtr = Unmanaged.passRetained(ctx).toOpaque()
if let handle = sc_thread_create(parallelToolCallback, ctxPtr) {
    threadHandles.append(handle)
}
```

Results land in a `ParallelResultsBox`; a mutex-protected array of optionals, one slot per thread. After all threads are joined, results are collected in order.

### Signals and atomics

The abort flag — the thing that lets Ctrl+C cleanly cancel an in-flight LLM request — is a `volatile sig_atomic_t` allocated in C. It has to be in C because you can't install a SIGINT handler from Embedded Swift (no `signal()` or `sigaction()` binding), and signal handlers can only safely write to `volatile sig_atomic_t`. The Swift side wraps it in an `AbortFlag` class that reads and writes through opaque pointer calls:

```swift
final class AbortFlag: @unchecked Sendable {
    private let flag: OpaquePointer

    func isSet() -> Bool {
        sc_atomic_flag_read(UnsafeMutableRawPointer(flag)) != 0
    }
}
```

### argc/argv

There's no `CommandLine.arguments` in Embedded Swift. On macOS, you can use `_NSGetArgc()`/`_NSGetArgv()`. On Linux, you need a `__attribute__((constructor))` function in C that captures `argc` and `argv` before `main` runs. The Swift side calls `sc_get_argc()` and `sc_get_argv(index)` — C functions defined in `Cstdio.h`.

## The JSON Problem

The `Any` type doesn't exist in Embedded Swift. No existentials, no type erasure, no runtime type metadata. This sounds like a footnote until you try to work with JSON.

JSON is inherently heterogeneous. An object's values can be strings, numbers, booleans, nulls, arrays, or nested objects — all in the same container. In standard Swift, `JSONSerialization` gives you `[String: Any]` and you cast your way through it. With `Codable`, you define structs and the compiler generates the mapping. I didn't know this but apparently both rely on `Any` or runtime reflection.

In Embedded Swift, neither exists.

**What you might try first:** A pure Swift enum:

```swift
enum JSONValue {
    case string(String)
    case number(Double)
    case bool(Bool)
    case null
    case array([JSONValue])
    case object([(String, JSONValue)])
}
```

This works for reading. But constructing complex nested JSON trees — like an OpenRouter API request with messages, tool definitions, and parameter schemas — becomes deeply unwieldy. And you still need a parser.

**What you might try next:** Generic approaches, protocol-based abstractions, result builders. They all hit walls without `Any` or runtime type metadata. You can't have a heterogeneous dictionary. You can't type-erase.

**What I landed on:** Wrapping [cJSON](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON), a battle-tested single-file C library for JSON parsing and generation. The Swift wrapper is a `JSONValue` class with RAII semantics:

```swift
final class JSONValue: @unchecked Sendable {
    let pointer: UnsafeMutablePointer<cJSON>
    private var owned: Bool
    private let root: JSONValue?
}
```

Every `JSONValue` is either *owned* (it will `cJSON_Delete` its tree on `deinit`) or *borrowed* (it holds a strong reference to its root, keeping the tree alive via ARC). When you attach a child to a parent — say, adding a key-value pair to an object — the child calls `relinquishOwnership()` so it won't double-free when it goes out of scope.

```swift
subscript(key: String) -> JSONValue? {
    set {
        guard let newValue else { return }
        cJSON_AddItemToObject(self.pointer, key, newValue.pointer)
        newValue.relinquishOwnership()
    }
}
```

The irony isn't lost on me: I'm writing manual memory management in Swift, a language famous for making memory management automatic. But it works, it's fast, and it keeps the binary small. The entire JSON layer — parsing, building, serializing — is 170 lines of Swift wrapping a vendored C library.

Building an API request looks like this:

```swift
let root = JSONValue.object()
root?["model"] = .string(model)
root?["stream"] = .bool(true)
root?["messages"] = .array(messages.map { $0.toJSON() })
```

Compare that to `try JSONEncoder().encode(request)`. More verbose, sure. But no reflection, no runtime metadata, no hidden allocations. Just pointer manipulation with a safety net.

## The Agent Builds Itself

I've worked with C before, but never to this extent. Luckily, I had a coding agent handy that could help me. Once the initial implementation was working in Swift, I used the agent to help port itself to embedded Swift. Most of the code in this repository was written by the agent running inside its own binary. The final numbers are below and I'm pretty happy with them. A 195 kilobyte binary that boots in 120 milliseconds. This agent, significantly more fully featured than obra/smallest-agent, is smaller than most JPEGs. If you want to try running it yourself, go to the repo at [dawsonamf/EmbeddedSwiftAgent](https://github.com/dawsonamf/EmbeddedSwiftAgent) and follow the instructions in the README.

The final numbers:

| Linux aarch64 stripped binary | **195.0 KB** (199,680 bytes) |
| Startup to interactive prompt | **~120 ms** (mean of 30 runs, σ=1.9ms) |
| Tools | 10 (sh, read_file, write_file, str_replace, glob, grep, web_search, web_fetch, subagent, mcp) |
| Swift source files | 16 |
